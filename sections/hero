            <div class="card-content">
                <p>We are Aarav Marfatia, Arya Jain, and Seshav Krishnan. Here's a story that shows how we work:</p>
                <p>Last year, a 5th grader we knew was really struggling with fractions. He felt frustrated because no matter how many worksheets he did, the numbers just didn’t “click.”</p>
                <p>Instead of just telling him the answers, we worked with him step by step. First, we explained fractions using pizza slices and candy bars (because math feels easier when it’s about food!). Then, we showed him how fractions connect to decimals using his favorite video game scores.</p>
                <p>At first, he still made mistakes, but we stayed patient and kept finding new ways to explain the same idea. After a couple of weeks, something amazing happened—he started solving fraction problems on his own, and even got an A on his math quiz.</p>
                <p class="takeaway"><strong>What we learned from that experience is that every student has a different way of learning. Sometimes all it takes is patience, creativity, and explaining things in a way that makes sense to them. That’s exactly how we work with every student we tutor.</strong></p>
